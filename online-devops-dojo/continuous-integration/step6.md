## Step Six

## Tasks

The pipeline found an error which we need to fix. We can add new changes (commits) in the existing pull request to fix the error.  

* Open GitHub pull requests in your repository: [https://github.com/{your_username}/pet-clinic/pulls](https://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-9876-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/#pr)  
* Open the pull request you have in progress.  
* In the `Files changed` tab, click on ... (on the right side) and select `Edit file`.
* Around line 51, replace the "Jolly Jumper" line with the following line: `INSERT INTO pets VALUES (14, 'Jolly Jumper', '2012-09-20', 7, 5);`{{copy}}
  
> This fixes the error in the original code - adds closing `)`  

* In the "Commit changes" summary, enter a comment like: `Fix parenthesis`{{copy}}  
* Commit the code into the same branch (for example `us-1-horse-db`).  

> At this point, the Jenkins pipeline will be triggered again. It will again compile the code, run the automated tests and give the pass/fail verdict within the pull request.  

* Go to <a href="https://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-8080-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/blue/organizations/jenkins/pet-clinic/" target="jenkins">Jenkins</a> to see the continuous integration pipeline execution.
