# Conclusion

Congratulations! You just experienced version control:

* Proposing changes within a short lived feature branch  
* Submit a pull request  
* Looked for feedback with a peer review  
* Iterate on the change  
* Merge the change in the `master` branch  

This process is appropriate for a small team, but can also scale for very large teams. Remember, this process is applicable not only to application code, but also documentation, infrastructure, and any type of text based asset.
