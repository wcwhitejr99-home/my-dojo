# Peer review

> ![Dan](../../assets/online-devops-dojo/version-control/dan.png)   OK, you submitted your changes. They are ready to be reviewed by someone before they get merged.  Let's ask for a lightweight peer review within the pull request.  

## Steps

* In the pull request you have just created, enter a comment to ask for a review from **Paulo**, our product owner:  `/paulo - can you please review this pull request?`{{copy}}  

> (It's important you type the comment exactly like that for the lab to work - you may want to copy/paste the comment).  

* Paulo will provide its comments.  
* Go back to the editor and change the code according to Paulo's comments.  
* Let's push the updated code back to GitHub:  
  * `git status`{{execute}}: where are we? What are the files which have been changed?  
  * `git add .`{{execute}}: adding all the files in the current directory (denoted by using `.`) to the staging area  
  * `git commit -m "Taking Paulo's comments into account"`{{execute}}: commit the changes in the *local* repository  
  * `git push`{{execute}}: push the changes back to GitHub  

* From the pull request, ask Paulo for another review by adding a new comment: `/paulo - made your changes - can you check now?`{{copy}}  
* Once Paulo is happy with the changes, **Paulo** will merge the pull request.  note: only authorized users can approve and merge.
