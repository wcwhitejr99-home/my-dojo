Before embarking on the DevOps transformation Chun works with the team to create their DevOps Manifesto.

The Pet Clinic development team's DevOps Manifesto is comprised of a set of foundational values and supporting principles. 

The manifesto outlines how DevOps will be used by the team in support of the incremental development and rapid delivery of high-quality working software to their customers in the business.

**Pet Clinic Development Team's DevOps Manifesto**

- **Optimized**: We optimize end to end. No local-only optimization.  
- **Inner Source**: All of our code is Inner Source. Our work is visible.  
- **Scientific**: We formulate hypotheses; validate them with experience and data, continuously testing.  
- **APIs**: Resources are controlled by APIs. Everything as code (version control, peer reviewed, automatically tested).  
- **Pipelines**: All our changes go through our continuous delivery pipelines: application, compute, storage, DB, network, OS. No alternative.  
- **Teams**: Integrated, empowered, self organizing teams.  
- **Trust**: We value trust and responsibility. But we verify â€“ through the CI/CD pipeline.  

Based on the manifesto the team agree to prioritize the following activities:

- Source Code Management  
- CI/CD Pipeline  
- Test Automation  
- Documentation as code  
- Infrastructure as code  
- Safety Culture
