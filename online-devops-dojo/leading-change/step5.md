Paulo invites Chun to introduce herself and asks her to share her lessons learned from previous DevOps Transformations where she has worked.  

Chun explains that she is a coach, change facilitator, and technologist.

She further explains that she is committed to growing the DevOps champion community in the organizations she works with by leveraging her experience to coach others.  

Chun's shares her top lessons learned from previous transformation efforts with the team:

- Culture eats Transformation for Lunch  
- Tools are [least] important  
- Leadership support is key  
- Invest in a Small Enablement group  
- Choose wisely what is mandated and top-down  
- Donâ€™t skip the Value Stream Mapping step  
- Set overall goals/measures  
- Create Improvement Themes  
- Impliment Continuous Improvement via DevOps Kaizen - NOT a Big Bang approach  
- Focus on a small set of common capabilities / shared services  
- Develop Champions, Change Agents, Coaches  
- Start now and never finish  
 
The team are excited and challenged by the new strategic move.  Paulo thanks Chun for the overview and opens the floor to questions.
