    This all sounds wonderful, but how do we start?
---
speaking: Chun

    In one sentence - By assessing current state, defining what awesome would look like, and putting a plan in place to incrementally address any deltas identified between current state and awesome.

    I am reminded of the old quote "When eating an elephant, take one bite at a time."
---
speaking: Chun

    Exactly. In our case each bite would be comprised of a two week continuous improvement event. These events are also known as DevOps Kaizen events. But I am getting ahead of myself. Let me answer Santhosh's question first.

speaking: Chun
text: >
    Santhosh, we would start by assessing current state of the development process using Value Stream Mapping (VSM).
---
speaking: Chun
text: >
    VSM will give us a shared understanding of the current process, with some key process metrics for each step in the process. These metrics would include: lead time, processing time and % C/A (which is the % complete versus accurate work received by each step in the process from the previous step in the process).
---

    With your help, we should be able to conduct a VSM exercise. I suspect it will be an interesting and productive exercise for the team.
---
speaking: Chun
text: >
    Good, but remember we need representatives from all groups with an interest in the process to take part.
---
speaking: Paulo
text: >
    Got it, I will reach out to the upstream and downstream groups to make sure they engage.
---
speaking: Chun
text: >
    Then having come to an agreed understanding of the current process, we, as a group, need to define what awesome would look like.
---

    What is "Awesome"?
---
speaking: Chun
text: >
    Yes, collectively we need to agree on what a perfect process looks like. Awesome is our target condition.
---
speaking: Dan
text: >
    And how do we plan on reaching that target?
---
speaking: Chun
text: >
    One bite at a time, or to be precise, executing a series of continuous improvement events - also known as Kaizen events. DevOps Kaizen events focus on improving customer/client outcomes by making incremental improvements across the entire value stream.

    I know it is a lot to take in, but I am confident with Chun's coaching, with the support of our leadership, and with your 
    commitment we will transform our operation for the better.
