## Leading Change module

## Purpose

DevOps Transformations, like any other transformational activity, can be challenging as enacting changes at scale can be hard, time-consuming, and require persistence.  

The **primary objective** of the "Leading Change" module is to help you understand that a major factor in the success of DevOps transformations is driven by the organization's ability to empower people to lead change at different levels in the organization.  

While there are challenges in Leading Change in support of DevOps transformations, the rewards are quickly evident as the team and the wider organization begin to experience the benefits which accrue from a successful DevOps transformation.  

The **secondary objective** of the module is to give you an opportunity to virtually participate in a Leading Change real world scenario.
