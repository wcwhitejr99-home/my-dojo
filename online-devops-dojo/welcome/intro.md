This course was adapted from content created by [DXC Technology](https://dxc-technology.github.io/about-devops-dojo/)  

This course is made up of 6 open source modules.  

* Leading Change  
* Version Control  
* Continuous Integration  
* Shift Left On Security  
* Value Stream Mapping  
* DevOps Kaizen  

## Katacoda environment  

The modules in this course make use of Katacoda environments. These are ephemeral environments which are created just for you, on the fly. However, your session will time out after one hour. The good news is that you can play and explore, or simply follow the script: it is your own environment.  

So, go grab a cup of your favorite caffeinated beverage, close your email, put your phone on airplane mode, and let's get started!  

## Welcome module

In this Welcome module, we will get you started by setting up your dedicated environment to allow you complete the labs for the subsequent modules in the **Unicorn Online DevOps Dojo**.
