This is a story of a business, multiple teams, an application, and the delivery chain (their continuous delivery pipeline).  

The primary team is part of the IT organization of a large Pet Clinic. The Pet Clinic runs its business on a Java application. The application includes features to manage a list of clients (pet owners), their pets, and a list of veterinarians with their
specialties.  

The Pet Clinic IT team develops, tests, deploys and supports the application.
