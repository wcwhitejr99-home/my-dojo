## Welcome  

Welcome to the **Unicorn Online DevOps Dojo** lab  

## DevOps Kaizen  

## Purpose

The **primary objective** of the "DevOps Kaizen" module is to help you to understand the principles and benefits of DevOps Kaizen. This will enable you and your team to use DevOps Kaizen (Continuous Improvement) as both a framework and as a repeatable process to help empower your team. You will learn how DevOps Kaizen can be used to identify and fix issues with, and to continuously improve your Value Streams.  

The **secondary objective** is to give you an opportunity to participate in a DevOps Kaizen real world scenario using Katacoda in *your* Sandbox environment.

<div style="text-align: left">ðŸ’¡ **Remember** the Sandbox is your personal clone of the Pet Clinic Repository.  The Sandbox is the one which you created in the Welcome module. <br>  
If you have not completed the Welcome module you should do so before continuing with the VSM module. <br>  
You are free to experiment in your Sandbox without fear of impacting the lab or other learners.</div>
