## Step Two

Come with us on a journey. Let's rewind and take to trip back in time to the Pet Clinic offices of a year ago. We need to look back in order to better understand where the team was, and how they used VSM to understand and change their end to end process.  

## Fade In ..

We open in the *war* room -  strewn with energy drink cans, pizza boxes, and the distinct smell of perspiration in the air.  

The team, tired and tense, are suffering from a long couple of days spent addressing issues following an upgrade to a key system.  They are holding a post-mortem into the issues with the upgrade. The question at hand is why another major upgrade to the system was delivered late, prone to errors, and suffered periodic performance issues.  

![brenda](../../assets/online-devops-dojo/welcome/brenda.png)   **Brenda** is not happy!  She is explaining to the team that this is not the first event of this nature, and the how this impacts the business. She also outlines the effects issues of this nature are having on her and the teams credibility.  

It is a not a pleasant meeting... Developers are blaming testers, testers are blaming developers, project managers are pointing to infrastructure issues, and admins are pointing to planning issues.  
The only thing everyone seems to agree on is that **someone else** is more to blame than they are for the problem.

![paulo](../../assets/online-devops-dojo/welcome/paulo.png)   **Paulo** the product owner, who is relatively new to the company, proposes using VSM as an approach to help identify the root causes of the issues and provide a basis to start improving from.  
Paulo explains to the team how VSM was used extensively, and to great effect, in his previous company.  
The team, eager to explore a potential solution to the challenges they are facing, are open (although slightly skeptical) to hearing more about VSM.  

**Paulo** engages **Chun** (the DevOps coach) to co-host a session outlining VSM to the team.

![chun](../../assets/online-devops-dojo/welcome/chun.png)  **Chun** explains how an IT Value stream is the process, including all steps a team follows, to get changes and feature implementations into production thus delivering business value.  
She explains that VSM is the process of aligning the entire team around an agreed upon understanding of the steps, processes, timings, and constraints in a Value Stream.  This helps the team to identify, agree, and prioritize improvement steps.  

VSM focuses the DevOps work on improvements which achieve the largest business value, thus helping organizations create blueprints in support of Lean transformations.

This is **Value Stream Mapping**.  

> ‚úè **Note**: This example leverages a VSM to evaluate the entire Software Development Lifecycle used by the team.  VSM is just as valuable when performed on smaller (any) processes.
