## Welcome

Welcome to the **Unicorn Online DevOps Dojo** lab  

## Value Stream Mapping (VSM)

## Purpose

The **primary objective** of the "Value Stream Mapping" (VSM) module is to help you to understand the principles and benefits of VSM. This module will enable you and your team to use VSM to better understand your current processes and to identify and fix issues with those processes.  

The **secondary objective** is to give you an opportunity to complete a VSM real world scenario using Katacoda in *your* Sandbox environment.  

<div style="text-align: left">ðŸ’¡ **Remember** the Sandbox is your personal clone of the Pet Clinic Repository.  The Sandbox is the one which you created in the Welcome module. <br>
If you have not completed the Welcome module you should do so before continuing with the VSM module. <br>  
You are free to experiment in your Sandbox without fear of impacting the lab or other learners.</div>
