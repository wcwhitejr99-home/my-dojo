## The VSM Session

With the support of leadership, the team has scheduled a two-day session to create the VSM.  

Representatives from all stakeholders in the value stream, (i.e. the Pet Clinic software development process) have been included.  

The purpose of this session is to discuss, discover, and agree on a shared understanding of what is currently happening in the End To End (E2E) process.  

**Paulo**, who is leading the exercise, has stressed the importance of resisting the temptation to document what is *supposed to happen* but to focus on what is *actually happening*.

The process the team followed to create the VSM can be described as:

1. **Identified the Value Stream to be mapped** - Pet Clinic Software Development Process.  
2. **Empowered the team** - ensured all stakeholders represented.  
3. **Agreed on the problem statement** - We need to deliver defect free software that meets business requirements quicker and more frequently.  
4. **Agreed on the scope** - Which parts of the process VSM was to include and just importantly, what parts it would not.  
5. **Walked the process and documented** - agreed on the process steps - took multiple passes through the process.  
6. **Collected process data** - lead times, processing times, complete and accurate work per step.  
7. **Agreed on the VSM results** - represented the current state of the Pet Clinic Software Development Process.  
8. **Analyzed the VSM and agreed on moving forward** - which the remainder of this module will cover.
